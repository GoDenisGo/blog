# blog
Repo for my personal blog.

My blog is where I will a profile about myself, including who I am and my interests. Currently being developed in my free time.

## How to install and run
This server is built on a Windows 11 machine.

You will need:
- Latest version of Golang. You will use Go tooling to compile a working executable.
- Latest version of Node (JavaScript + Node Package Manager). This is important if you want the correct environment for
getting scripts to run.

1. git clone "github.com/GoDenisGo/blog" into a directory of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and change directory into the root of the project.
3. Run "go build blog.go" (this will turn the Go server into an executable).
4. Run "./blog" (this will start the server) switch to a web browser.
5. Enter "http://localhost:8080/" into the URL bar. The website should now be loaded.

If there are any errors, please notify me through GitHub issues or via email.

## Rationale (why do I need a blog? Who is it for?)
I want this blog to be seen as a creative personal project. I want to use it as a chance to stretch my skills and try
something new. I also want the audience to see what the project is made of and make comments on it.

## Commitments
This is a list of ideas that I have for completing this project.

- CV and Blog pages: I want to include one button for viewing my profile, and another button or creative menu design to
view my most recent discussions.
- Creative design features: as part of the creative menu design, I intend to make the website themed around a particular
genre, most likely science fiction. I could design different menus to look like computer screens. My welcome page could
end up looking like a science lab with features depicting experimentation and futuristic gadgets. This is likely to be
implemented last, as part of my Minimum Viable Product approach.
- Working JavaScript: I opted to use Golang for my server because I felt like working with something I hadn't used
before. I would like to use JavaScript to provide more interesting functionality such as modifying page elements and
aiding usability.
- Working database: I want to implement a Postgres database in order to save page content instead of using text files.
Other saved data could include dates and key descriptions. This could enable other features too.
- Live website on the web: If I feel content with my project at any stage, I will attempt to find a provider that could
host my website for me. This will require research and won't happen until the website itself is capable of delivering
what I want.

## Feedback
This is a bold new step for me; hopefully the audience can review and critique my skills. The audience may submit a request here on GitHub, or contact me via my email address officialdeniskras@gmail.com.

Thank you!
