Repo for my personal blog.

My blog is where I keep a profile about myself, including who I am and my interests. Currently being developed in my free time.

## Rationale (why do I need a blog? Who is it for?)
I will attempt to use the blog to write about my thoughts, kind of like a diary, but less consistent and more random.

I decided to make the blog repo public- anyone can see the architecture I used including the software that goes into making it. I aim to keep my blog nice and simple. You can think of it as an online CV, but more personalised. Social media is an alternative, but I believe developing a personal blog is an effective way of enhancing my skills. I can even use this as a chance to experiment and learn.

I feel anybody should get to see this blog- experienced professionals, friends and family. I am not discriminant and could appreciate feedback from a diverse group of readers to help me improve.

At any stage in the development process- perhaps later on when I feel I should- I may change the direction of this blog with more sophisticated networking features and artistic design choices.

## Feedback
This is a bold new step for me; hopefully the audience can review and critique my skills. The audience may submit a request here on GitHub, or contact me via my email address officialdeniskras@gmail.com.

Thank you!
