[[Heading]]Welcome to my internet home...[[Heading]]

[[Body]]This is filler text for future development.

I plan to use this blog to show off a bit more about who I am and what I'm interested in.

Since I have a summer job, development might be slow until I begin University again.

Although, I will definitely try to keep up with my projects.

Since I need sample text, I guess I will talk about random things. Don't expect anything interesting.

I like the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. Reading those novels was the first time I ever laughed at a book.
The fast pace of each plot keeps the books fresh and exiting. The focus for me is the language and literary
devices. The use of polysemy throughout each novel enables the audience to visualize the mythical world in ways that are
unorthodox. This opens up different passages for the story to take, which makes the Discworld series more unique. In
this way, I believe that reading has strengthened my mind from the point of view that you need to understand core
messages without losing sight of the general direction of text.
